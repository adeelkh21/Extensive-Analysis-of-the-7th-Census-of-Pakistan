## Dataset Overview
Sourced from the **Pakistan Bureau of Statistics**, the dataset includes:
- **Population Demographics**
- **Housing Characteristics** 
- **Water Access**
- **Literay**
- **Languages**
- **Energy Sources**

### Key Statistics:
- **Total Population:** 246M  
- **Population Growth Rate:** 2.82%  
- **Solar Usage:** 7% (higher adoption in rural Balochistan)  
- **Housing Type:** 55% Pakka, 24.85% Kacha, 19.58% Semi-Pakka

## Tools & Technologies
- **Power BI** for dashboards and interactive visuals.
- **Mapbox** for geo-spatial visualizations.
- **DAX** for calculated metrics.

## Key Insights
1. **Housing & Energy:**
   - Over 50% reliance on wood for cooking.
   - Solar adoption remains low but promising in Balochistan.
2. **Water Access:**
   - Sindh shows higher use of filtered water, while Balochistan relies on external sources.
3. **Linguistic Diversity:**
   - Diverse linguistic patterns require culturally tailored policies.
4. **Population Growth:**
   - Rapid urbanization demands improved planning and infrastructure.

## Recommendations
- **Expand Solar Programs** in rural areas.
- **Invest in Water Infrastructure** in underserved regions.
- **Targeted Education Programs** in Balochistan and South Punjab.
- **Improve Urban Housing Policies** to meet growing demand.
